# Spongebobs Bikini Bottom Clicky Game (React.js)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### About

* This is a memory game built with `React.js`. The goal of the game is simple, using your mouse, `CLICK` each of the `Spongebob` character cards in whatever order you chose - the order does not matter, only that you do not click the same card twice!  

* `EACH` click triggers the board of cards to reshuffle, thus, you cannot simply click the cards in the order in which they appear on screen.

* `COUNTERS` displayed to the top right of the board keep track of your current as well as top score.

* `CLICK` your way to the highest score!

### Summary

* `Spongebobs-Clicky-Game` is built with `React.js`. Thus, the application is component based, able to keep track of change events using `state`, and updates to the page render dynamically and without page refresh.
